# A little dart script thingy that generates math tasks for first graders

# Usage:

* Simply run it
```shell
> dart run bin/mati.dart
```

* Compile it (and then run the binary)
```shell
# compile to .exe file. If you do not like .exe files
# on non windows machines use the ```-o``` option to give it a decent name 
> dart compile exe bin/mati.dart
```

* Test it
```shell
# testing this is a bit funny but:
> dart test
```
